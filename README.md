#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineeering is simply designing, developing, testing,implimenting and maintaining softwares.
software engeneering importance to the technology industry is that, it as mad command autiomation easy, fast and affective hence better outcomes for the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
agile methodology -its a set of techniques and principles designed to guide and improve how software development work to to deliver new applications and updates.
artificial itelligency- this are a set of technologies that enable computers to perform advanced funtions like seeing understanding and transalting languages, making recomendations and more.
cloud computing-its the on demand availability ofcomputer system resources without the active involvement of the user.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning stage- it involves identifing a problem that you want to solve and determing the objectives of the new software you want to develope.
analysis stage- it involves gathering all the details required for a new sstem and also determing the first idea of the prtotypes.
design stage- it involves outlining the details of the overall application together with specific aspects such as user interface, system interface, network requirement and datadase.
development stage-it involves writing the code and building the application according to the early design  documented.
testing stage-it involves testing the software to make sure there are no bugs the end user expirience is  effective.
implimenting stage-  it involves intergrating the software into the environment and installing it.
maintainance stage- it involves maintaining the mode and begin practicing any activities required to hundle the issues reported by the end users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
copmarision
both waterfall and agile emthodologies are used to develope and deliver high quality software productsthat meets the end user expectaions.
contrast
waterfall methodology offers predictability but may struggle with accomodation changes later on in the development cycle making it more sustainable and predictable the best scinarios that its applicable is in the construction industry while agile methodology best suits dynamic environments and and allows continues changes through out the development cycle making it very flexible and collaborativ, the best scenarios to use agile methodology is in product design.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
analysind problems the designing and deloping softwares to counter those problems.
 maintaining new and existing software to make sure that they are eefficient and affective to the end user.
 quality assurance engineer
 ensuring that softwares developed are of good quality before they are launched
 monitoring and overseeing every stage of a software development cycle.
 making suggestions and corrections to improve a software futures.
 project manager
 create and lead a the team.
 manage the money dispersed forthe project
 evaluate the projects performance

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are equiped witha host of futures such as code complition, syntax highlighting,error detection that speed up the coding process and boosts productivity, an example is visual studio developed by microsoft.
VCS enhances code quality and accelaratesdevelopment time  and improves project visibility an exampli is git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
lack of workflow visibility-developers teams suffer because of a vague understanding of the engeneering processes within a organisation, many not having the clarity abouts projects and activities.this can be overcomed by investing inproject management  tools that empower a tem to make decisions.
 broken software developmeant life cycles- the SDLC can be broken at any level and to overcome this an organisation needs to perserve the integrity of their SDLC process.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 unit testing
 its asoftware development process were the smallest testable part of an app is individually scrutinized for proper oparations. its importance is that it helps detect early flows in a code which might be more defficult to find  later on.
 intergration testing
  its a software testing tool in which different modules of o software application are tested as a combined entinty.its importance is that it ensured that all modules work together well after integration.
  system testing
   it is a series of different types of tests with the porpuse to exercise and examine the full working of an integrated software computer system. its importance is that it improves consistence and efficiency by finding errors and defects that are corrected .
   acceptance testing
 its a formal testing according to the user requirements and business processes conducted to deterine whether a system satisfies th users needs. its importance is that it verifys thata system meets all of its funtional and non funtional requirements.
   

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 prompt engeneering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be intepreted and understood by a generative artificial intelligency model.the importance of prompt ingeneering in AI models is that iz helps optimize the results after a user interacts with AI systems for precise and desired outcomes.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me everything about governance in kenya".
iproved version
"Provide a coprihesive overview of governance in kenya, including its political structure, key institutions and government branches."
